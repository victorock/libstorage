# Release Notes

Release early, release often

## Version 0.1.5 (2016/07/12)
This release comes hot on the heels of the last, but some dynamite bug fixes

that were taking minutes now take seconds or less. Memory consumption that
could exceed 50GB is now kept neat and tidy.

### Bug Fixes

* Context logger optimizations ([#224](https://github.com/emccode/libstorage/issues/224))

### Enhancements
* Improved volume path caching ([#227](https://github.com/emccode/libstorage/issues/227))
* Make Gometalinter optional ([#223](https://github.com/emccode/libstorage/issues/223))


## Version 0.1.4 (2016/07/08)
This update provides a major performance improvement as well as a few other,
minor bug fixes and enhancements.

* Performance degradation bug ([#218](https://github.com/emccode/libstorage/issues/218))
* Close bug in ScaleIO driver ([#213](https://github.com/emccode/libstorage/issues/213))
* Panic when checking attached instances with Isilon driver ([#211](https://github.com/emccode/libstorage/issues/211))

### Enhancements
* Improved build process ([#220](https://github.com/emccode/libstorage/issues/220))
* Improved executor logging ([#217](https://github.com/emccode/libstorage/issues/217))
* Log timestamps in ms ([#219](https://github.com/emccode/libstorage/issues/219))
* Updated ScaleIO docs ([#214](https://github.com/emccode/libstorage/issues/214))

## Version 0.1.3 (2016/06/14)
This is a minor update to support the release of REX-Ray 0.4.0.

### Enhancements
* Marshal to YAML Enhancements ([#203](https://github.com/emccode/libstorage/issues/203))

## Version 0.1.2 (2016/06/13)
This release updates the default VirtualBox endpoint to `http://10.0.2.2:18083`.

## Version 0.1.1 (2016/06/10)
This is the initial GA release of libStorage.

### Features
libStorage is an open source, platform agnostic, storage provisioning and
orchestration framework, model, and API. Features include:

- A standardized storage orchestration
  [model and API](http://docs.libstorage.apiary.io/)
- A lightweight, reference client implementation with a minimal dependency
  footprint
- The ability to embed both the libStorage client and server, creating native
  application integration opportunities

### Operations
`libStorage` supports the following operations:

Resource Type | Operation | Description
--------------|-----------|------------
Volume | List / Inspect | Get detailed information about one to many volumes
       | Create / Remote | Manage the volume lifecycle
       | Attach / Detach | Provision volumes to a client
       | Mount / Unmount | Make attached volumes ready-to-use, local file systems
Snapshot | | Coming soon
Storage Pool | | Coming soon

### Getting Started
Using libStorage can be broken down into several, distinct steps:

1. Configuring [libStorage](/user-guide/config.md)
2. Understanding the [API](http://docs.libstorage.apiary.io)
3. Identifying a production server and client implementation, such as
   [REX-Ray](https://rexray.rtfd.org)
